exeJ is a command line tool that creates a "batch-like" executable (.exe file) for your java application. 
The command line used to start your java application is wrapped in the generated executable and the user 
can simply start the java application with a double-click. 
The generated .exe is Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP compatible.
